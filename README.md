1. Create two divs. One blue with the text inside "Before Hover." And another red one that is
hidden with the text "After Hover." When you hover over the blue one, the red will show, and the
blue one will be hidden. When you remove the mouse from the red one, the blue one will
reappear.

2. Create one div and two buttons right and left. When clicking right, move the div by 10px right;
when clicking left, move the div by 10px left.

3. Create five dynamic divs with javascript. Each div should have your name letters as text hidden
in the beginning. After you hover the mouse over the divs, the letters should appear. 

4. Add three images on a page full width but show only the first one as default. Create two arrows
below the images and slide the next one when clicking on the arrows.

5. Write a JavaScript function to get the last day of the month. The function should get the month
as a parameter and return the month's last day.

6. There is a given object; write a javascript program to print the given object's properties, delete the
second property and get the object's length.
 ```javascript
let user = {
   first_name: "John",
   last_name: "Smith",
   age: "38",
   department: "Software"
};
```
